Calendar booking II

Implement a MyCalendarTwo class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a
triple booking.
Your class will have one method, book(int start, int end). Formally, this represents a booking on the half open
interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common
to all 3 events.)
For each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully
without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
Your class will be called like this: MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar(); MyCalendar.book(start, end)
Example 1:
MyCalendar();
MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(50, 60); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(10, 40); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(5, 15); // returns false
MyCalendar.book(5, 10); // returns true
MyCalendar.book(25, 55); // returns true
Explanation:
The first two events can be booked.  The third event can be double booked.
The fourth event (5, 15) can't be booked, because it would result in a triple booking.
The fifth event (5, 10) can be booked, as it does not use time 10 which is already double booked.
The sixth event (25, 55) can be booked, as the time in [25, 40) will be double booked with the third event;
the time [40, 50) will be single booked, and the time [50, 55) will be double booked with the second event.
Approach:
We store an array self.overlaps of intervals that are double booked, and self.calendar for intervals which have been
single booked. We use the line start < j and end > i to check if the ranges [start, end) and [i, j) overlap.
The clever idea is we do not need to "clean up" ranges in calendar: if we have [1, 3] and [2, 4], this will be
calendar = [[1,3],[2,4]] and overlaps = [[2,3]]. We don't need to spend time transforming the calendar to
calendar = [[1,4]]
This approach has been discussed in the LC official solution
Time Complexity: O(N^2), where N is the number of events booked. For each new event, we process every previous event
to decide whether the new event can be booked. This leads to O(N^2) complexity.
Space Complexity: O(N)O(N), the size of the calendar
